    <h1>FairShare - easy way to split bills fairly</h1>
    <p>FairShare makes it easy to know how much you pay when you go out and eat with your friends.Simply enter the prices, choose what's yours, and it calculates for you.</p>
    <p>This is an app that I created during the Summer of 2017 while attending the Make School Summer Academy, aprogram which helped me develop Swift coding and app creation skills. Know more about Make School <u><a href= "https://www.makeschool.com" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</p>
    <p>The development process of this app/project is very important to me. It helped me understand coding logics better than any
      experience I have had. Before this project, I struggled with logics and algorithms and was not so sure if computer
      programming was really for me. Thanks to the assistance of Make School's Summer Academy, I became familiar with
      debugging and problem solving. Ultimately, I've become way more comfortable with writing codes and creating apps.</p>
